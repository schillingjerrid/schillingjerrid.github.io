      <p>
        I've always had a strong interest in learning how stuff works. Born in Aurora, CO, my family later moved to Wyoming where I was raised. From woodworking and electronics to homebrewing and software, I love to build things and improve my knowledge. I chose to go to the University of Wyoming after high school and while I didn't know what I wanted to do at the start, I knew that I enjoyed creating things. This lead me to start the Electrical Engineering curriculum. After a few years of that however, I decided that I would rather work with software a little more than my current major was offering. This lead me to majoring in Computer Engineering. I graduated from the University of Wyoming in May 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

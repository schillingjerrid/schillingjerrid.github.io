            <p>Jerrid Schilling was born in Aurora, CO and raised in Wyoming. He has always had a passion for technology and learning new things. He started programming in high school when a new class was offered to students called Intro to Video Game Development. He programmed simple video games using a programming language known as DarkBASIC. From here he delved into a few other new computer courses that were focused on computer animation. After doing very well in these classes he was asked by the class instructor to student teach and help him during some of his classes. After high school, Jerrid attended the University of Wyoming in Laramie, WY.</p>

            <p>As computers and technology were highly appealing to Jerrid, he decided to major in Electrical Engineering. After completing all of the base course requirements he changed his major to Computer Engineering as it better suited his passions and he graduated on May 14th, 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. He has worked multiple internships throughout his time in college and is constantly working to learn new technologies and languages. He has also joined a few local programming/coding meetups including Cheyenne Computer Professionals, Learn To Code Fort Collins, Northern Colorado .NET User Group, and PyNoCO. These have proven to be a great resource for meeting people, collaborating, and learning new things.</p>

            <p>Outside of computers and programming, Jerrid spends much of his time camping, fishing, and hiking with his wife, Evan, and his two dogs, Asher and Kodah. He also loves woodworking and uses a lot of the skills and knowledge he gained from his father, Mike, and his grandfather, Everett, as they are a great source of inspriation for him.</p>

            <h3>Multi-room Wi-Fi Sound System</h3>
            <h4>University of Wyoming Senior Design Project (September 2015 - April 2016)</h4>
            <p>The Multi-room Wi-Fi Sound System is a full audio equipment system that transmits audio over a Wi-Fi LAN connection from a mobile device running Android to a set of speakers. The idea was to eliminate the need for wiring up separate sound systems in different rooms of a house. With this system, a person could have speakers in every room of their home and connect to each one when they want to hear music. The mobile device used for the project was a LG tablet running Android Jellybean. The speaker set controller (which was hardwired to the speakers) used was a TI CC3200 Launchpad XL with a TI CC3200 Audio Booster Pack. The mobile device was developed using Android Studio and the speaker set controller was programmed using Code Composer Studio.</p>

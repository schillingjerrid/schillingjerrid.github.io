description: ChyDash was the result of my internship project for Holly Frontier Corp during my senior year of college. The dashboard was built as a database driven web application that populates a set of predetermined charts with data from a remote production level Oracle database. The project was started in May 2015 and was deemed complete in August 2016. It was created as private software and is still in use today.
technologies: C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, CSS, CanvasJS, Bootstrap

description: The Multi-room Wi-Fi Sound System is a full audio equipment system that transmits audio over a Wi-Fi LAN connection from a mobile device running Android to a set of speakers. The idea was to eliminate the need for wiring up separate sound systems in different rooms of a house. The mobile device used for the project was a LG tablet running Android Jellybean. The speaker set controller (which was hardwired to the speakers) was a TI CC3200 Launchpad XL with a TI CC3200 Audio Booster Pack. The mobile device was developed using Android Studio and the speaker set controller was programmed using Code Composer Studio.
technologies: C, Java, XML, Socket Programming
